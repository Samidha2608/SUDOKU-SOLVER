Intuition:
We need to fill the empty cells in the Sudoku grid while ensuring that no number repeats in any row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid. Backtracking will help explore potential solutions by placing a number in an empty cell and verifying if it satisfies Sudoku constraints. If it doesn't, we backtrack and try the next possible value.

Approach:
We will check for empty cells in the Sudoku grid.
For each empty cell, we will attempt to place a number from 1 to 9.
For each number, we will check if it is valid by ensuring it doesn't appear in the same row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid.
If a number is valid, we place it in the cell and recursively attempt to solve the next empty cell.
If placing a number leads to an unsolvable grid later, we backtrack by removing the number and trying the next possibility.
This process continues until the puzzle is either solved or found unsolvable.

Step-by-step Approach:
Traverse the grid to find an empty cell.
For each empty cell, try placing numbers 1 through 9.
Validate the placement of the number by checking the row, column, and sub-grid constraints.
If valid, recursively try to solve the rest of the grid.
If the grid becomes unsolvable, remove the number and try the next one.
Once the grid is completely filled, the puzzle is solved.

Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(9^(n*n))

Space Complexity: O(n*n)
